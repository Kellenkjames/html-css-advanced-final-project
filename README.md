# HTML + CSS Final Project Kickoff! ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the final project of the HTML + CSS UpSkill Course! Today you'll be putting together everything you've learned over the past two weeks to build out an ecommerce store. What you sell is completely up to (so be creative!). You'll have the rest of this evening as well as about 4 hours on Saturday during class to complete your project in whichever way you see fit. Leverage the tools you want to better understand, and maybe something new along the way. There will be specific points we'd love to see which will be outlined below, but the rest is up to you!

As you're building out your application, think about the experience of a variety of end-users, as well as new developers coming onto your team and getting up-to-speed with your codebase.

## Goals

The following points are things we'd love to see in your final projects â€” they're concepts pulled from the various topics we've covered:

- When a user first lands on your site, they should be greeted with carousel that displays an assortment of some of the items your shop carries
- When a user adds something to their cart, we should see the item "fly" across the page and land in the cart
- When a new item is added to the cart, the cart icon should show a number beside it indicating the number of items in the cart
- When a user wants to check-out, they should be greeted with a form where they fill out their billing and shipping information
- We'd love to see other animations as they scroll through your application â€” we've shared a link to a really creative and engaging site in Slack along with a couple mockups for inspiration!

## Presentations

Each team will have 5-10 minutes to present their final project. We'd love to hear about any challenges you faced, something you learned, and of course see the final product! No code please. ðŸ¤¯
